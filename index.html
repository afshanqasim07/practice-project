               Born on December 25, 1876,<br> Jinnah was a prominent lawyer, politician, and
               leader of the All India Muslim League. He played a pivotal role <br> in advocating 
               for the rights of Muslims in British India, leading to the creation of Pakistan 
               in 1947. Jinnah's <br> vision for Pakistan was a nation where all citizens could live
               in  harmony, free from discrimination. His  <br>dedication to the cause of independence
               and his efforts in shaping the newly formed country have made him  <br>a symbol of
               determination, leadership, and integrity in Pakistan's history.</p> <br><br>
